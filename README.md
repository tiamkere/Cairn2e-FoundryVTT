# Cairn2e for FoundryVTT - Maybe!

A first attempt at getting the 2e character creation for Cairn 2e up and running. 

This is based on the [FoundryVTT module](https://github.com/yochaigal/Cairn-FoundryVTT) for the [Cairn](https://cairnrpg.com) role-plyaing game by [Yochai Gal](https://newschoolrevolution.com). Cairn is a mashup of Knave and Into The Odd, meant for Wood Fantasy settings such as Necrotic Gnome's [Dolmenwood](https://necroticgnome.com/collections/dolmenwood).

The code is based on the [Electric Bastionland system](https://github.com/mvdleden/electric-bastionland-FoundryVTT/) for FoundryVTT (which in turn is based on the Into the Odd System).

## Installation 

Do not. Use the [official Cairn installation](https://github.com/yochaigal/Cairn-FoundryVTT) instead. This one's an unfinished experiment.
